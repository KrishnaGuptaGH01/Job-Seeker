## 🚀 Problem Statement
India faces a dual challenge: Unemployment and Unemployability. While jobs exist, the workforce often lacks the specific skills industries require. **SkillSetu AI** bridges this gap.

## 💡 The Solution
An AI-powered platform that acts as a bridge (*Setu*) between talent and opportunity.
1.  **For Students:** Analyzes resumes, identifies skill gaps, and recommends specific courses.

3.  **For Government:** A real-time dashboard to track skill penetration and unemployment heatmaps.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Live Market Data:** Scrapes job portals to find *current* in-demand skills.
